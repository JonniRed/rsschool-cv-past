## About me

I am a strong, organized person with specific goals and objectives. I rejoice in my victories, no matter how small they are, draw conclusions from mistakes and do not despair. My inner aspiration is to please people around me, to help solve issues and see them smile.

I am not afraid to ask for help, I know how to assess my strength and resources and distribute them depending on the importance of the task.
